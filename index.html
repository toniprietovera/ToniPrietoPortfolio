        <span class="title-project">ABOUT ME (1999)</span>
        <p>Since I was a child I have been surrounded by technology, especially computers, consoles and video games.
          That made me develop for years an interest in the way in which video games were created. To the point of
          wanting to study the design and development of these. </p>
        <p>As I grew up I saw my idyllic profession clearer by the time I finished high school, I studied a higher grade
          training cycle in multiplatform applications with a video game profile. And when I finished I started a
          university degree in Interactive Digital Contents which I'm about to finish.</p>
        <p>During my career, I have learned a lot, but it has also helped me to choose my destiny in this industry. And
          that's why I want to specialize in visual effects and become a Technical Artist professional.
        <p>
          However, I love to learn and improve my skills continuously.

          I'm a passionate student of game development.
          I would love to specialize in <span class="label gamedesign">Game Design</span>,
          <span class="label code">Scripting</span> and <span class="label vfx">VFX</span>,
          three fundamental aspects in creating exciting and engaging game experiences.
          I like to be self-taught and learn new things from other aspects of game development.

        <p>
          Here we can see a short game reel introducing shooter mechanics and a simple hud.
          The purpose of this project was to familiarize with Unreal Engine and it's features.
          <br>
          Existing assets have been used for this project, however you can see the implementation of motion, visual
          effects and programming.
